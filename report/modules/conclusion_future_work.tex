\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we provided an brief overview of cloud technologies in general, and then focused more on object and file storage services, defining them and comparing the performance, security, pricing schemes and features of some well known services. By highlighting these differences, we emphasize the importance that prospective users research all potential services before choosing which ones best suit their needs. Then, we covered the design of our python library which aims to provide a common interface for accessing many different cloud storage services, thereby simplifying and making it more convenient to use more than one such service at a time. Thus far, our library allows the use of Dropbox, Box, Google Drive and Amazon S3 for uploading, downloading and deleting files. We also outlined our implementation of the library, highlighting the different capabilities (regarding authentication and file management) of each SDK that we used in the process, and any resulting challenges we had to overcome. We also evaluated the performance of our library by measuring the execution time when uploading, downloading or deleting files of various sizes. From this evaluation, we found comparable performance across all services with the exception of Google Drive who severely under-performed when uploading large files (likely due to speed limitations set by the cloud provider). However, smaller differences were also observed as, for instance, Dropbox is the fastest when uploading small files, while S3 performs the best for large file uploads.

\section{Future work}
There exist various possible avenues for improving and building on our library in the future. Specifically, we believe it is worth investigating the use of multithreading when managing multiple files, to potentially improve performance.  Furthermore, the implementation of a progress bar when uploading or downloading large files could especially prove useful by keeping users informed of the progress at any point. The functionality offered by the library  could also be enhanced to provide more than the upload, download and deletion of files. For instance, providing the ability to move or rename files, to modify tags/labels of files or to control access to files (e.g. via file locks or S3's \ac{acl}) are all possible with the CSP-provided SDKs, and could improve the flexibility and usability of our tool. Finally, our library provides a solid basis for implementing additional cloud storage services other than the current four, to more reliably cover all the storage needs of users.
