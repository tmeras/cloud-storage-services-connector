\chapter{Cloud Storage Services Comparison}

\section{Introduction}
Cloud storage solutions are rapidly rising in popularity among individuals and enterprises, as the benefits of using such services in day-to-day life and business become more and more evident. Cloud storage applications like Google Drive are used by almost 40\% of households in certain areas while, by 2025, 100 \textit{Zettabytes} of data (50\% of all data) will be stored in the cloud \cite{zeta}. 

Customers nowadays have dozens of options when it comes to storage providers, some of the most popular ones being established providers like Dropbox \cite{dropbox} and tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft, which offer their \ac{s3} and Azure Blob services \cite{s3,blob}, respectively. These storage services, however, differ in certain characteristics like pricing, capacity and performance. It becomes important, then, to investigate these differences in order to make an educated decision on which service to adopt.
